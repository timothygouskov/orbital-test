# orbital-test
Test projects that are used by orbital's testing process

**Please note - This project is a WIP and is still undergoing testing**

## Overview

Each project is a small API that fetches minute-by-minute stock prices from the AlphaVantage API.

A full test encompasses that orbital is able to run it's pipeline against the source code (for each language) and successfully deploy a completed manifest and deployment to a k8s cluster.
